This directory contains project for determining the position and curvature of a DW bend.

The domain structure in iron garnet films can be changed by an application of an external electric field due to ME effect. These changes are displacements of existing magnetic inhomogeneities, deformations of them (including DW) and nucleations of new magnetic inhomogeneities. Here we are interested in the emergence of a bend in DW (a border between two stripe magnetic domains).

If ones sweep a domain structure state into a monodomain state (by an applied magnetic field) and bakcward then a recovered domain structure will be different from previous one. This difference is not deterministic. But there stil will exist some general tendencies that allow us to detect the positions of magnetic domains and DW (which experience bending under electric field due to ME effect).

In this directory there is a structure of a neural network that will find the positions and values (angles) of the bends of DW caused by an applied electric field.

A dataset wil contain an array of pairs of magnetooptical photos of domain structure near electrode: the first without an applied electric field and the second under an applied electric field. Also there are an array of positions and values of the bends on photos.
