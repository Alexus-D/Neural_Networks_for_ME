 Neural_Networks_for_ME
 
This directory contains project for using neural networks (NN) to study magnetoelectric (ME) effect. There are three proposal ways of aplications of NN here.
The first ('DW bend position' directory) contains a directory concerning the application of NN for determine the position and curvature of a domain wall (DW) bend.
The second ('Type of ME mechanism' directory) contains a directory concerning the application of NN to classify types of ME mechanisms depicted on pairs of magnetooptical photos.
The third ('Mythic ME places' directory) contains a directory concerning to search strange places on magnetooptical photos, where  ME effect is different from typical ME effect.
Detailed information is in each directory.
