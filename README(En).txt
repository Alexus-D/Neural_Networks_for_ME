 Neural_Networks_for_ME
 
This directory contains project for using neural networks (NN) to study magnetoelectric (ME) effect. There are three proposal ways of aplications of NN here. There are three  directories for each of them.
The first ('DW bend position' directory) concerns the application of NN for determine the position and curvature of a domain wall (DW) bend.
The second ('Type of ME mechanism' directory) concerns the application of NN to classify mechanisms of ME effect depicted on pairs of magnetooptical photos.
The third ('Mythic ME places' directory) concerns the searching of strange places on magnetooptical photos, where ME effect is different from typical ME effect in this sample.
Detailed information is in each directory.
